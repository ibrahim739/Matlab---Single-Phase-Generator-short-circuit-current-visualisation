%% This script reprents a Short circuit current calculation of an unloaded single phase generator.

% The Generator is modeled as a voltage source and a
% series RL branch which represents the internal parameters of the
% Generator

%% Brief explanation of the Single Phase short circuit calculation: 

% The total fault current also known as the Asymmetrical fault current is
% composed of two components: The Ac fault current also named as
% symmetrical current or steady-state fault current + the dc offset current
% which decays exponentially with time constant taw
% In this script, we assume Maximum Dc offset which represents the worst
% case.

%% The inputs to the function are:
% V which is the Rms voltage in Volts
% L is the internal inductance in Henry
% R is the internal resistance in ohm
% f is the operating frequency in Hertz

V = input('Please enter the Rms voltage in Volt: ');
L = input('Please enter the internal inductance in Henry: ');
R = input('Please enter the internal Resistance in ohm: ');
f = input('Please enter the operating frequency in Hertz: ');

%% Example (Typical input problems)
% A bolted short circuit occurs in a single phase generator with the maximum dc offset :
% V =20 kV, L = 0.0212 H, R = 0.8 Î© , F = 60 Hz.

% In this case, the inputs to the function are :

% V = 20000;
% L = 0.0212;
% R = 0.8;
% F = 60 ;
